  # Fix Mission Buildings RLS Policies - Final Version

  This migration addresses the persistent RLS policy violations when constatateurs
  try to add buildings to their assigned missions. The issue is likely due to
  complex JOIN conditions in the policy checks that may not be evaluating correctly.

  ## Changes Made

  1. **Simplified INSERT Policy**: Separate the role check from the mission check
     to make the policy evaluation more reliable
  2. **Clearer Logic**: Use simpler EXISTS clauses that are easier for PostgreSQL to evaluate
  3. **Better Debugging**: Add more granular conditions that can be tested individually

  ## Security

  - Maintains proper role-based access control
  - Ensures users can only modify missions they have access to
  - Preserves data integrity through proper foreign key relationships
