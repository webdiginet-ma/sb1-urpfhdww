  # Fix Mission Buildings RLS Policies to Include Draft Status

  This migration fixes the Row Level Security policies for the mission_buildings table
  to allow constatateurs to add buildings to missions even when they are in 'draft' status.

  ## Changes Made

  1. **Updated INSERT Policy**: Allow constatateurs to add buildings to missions with status:
     - 'draft' (newly added)
     - 'assigned' 
     - 'in_progress'

  2. **Updated DELETE Policy**: Consistent with INSERT policy for proper access control

  3. **Fixed Debug Function**: Properly drop and recreate to avoid return type conflicts

  ## Security

  - Maintains proper role-based access control
  - Allows constatateurs to work on draft missions
  - Preserves data integrity through proper foreign key relationships
